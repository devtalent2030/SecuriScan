# **👥 Guide Team to Work on the Frontend**

All frontend development should be pushed directly to the `dev` branch. Follow these steps:

---

## **📌 Steps to Start Working**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/devtalent2030/SecuriScan.git
   cd SecuriScan
   ```

2. **Switch to the dev branch:**
   ```sh
   git checkout dev
   ```

3. **Pull the latest updates:**
   ```sh
   git pull origin dev
   ```

4. **Start working on the frontend!** 🎉

---

## **📌 How to Push Updates**

Once you’ve made changes, follow these steps:

1. **Stage all changes:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit with a descriptive message:**
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Frontend UI updates: Added navbar component"
   ```

3. **Push directly to dev:**
   ```sh
   git push origin dev
   ```

🔹 🚨 **Important:** Always pull the latest changes from dev before pushing your own updates to avoid merge conflicts:
   ```sh
   git pull origin dev
   git push origin dev
   ```

**📌 Managing the dev Branch**

The dev branch is the main collaboration branch for all frontend and backend work.

Once the project is complete and fully tested, the dev branch will be merged into main.
```
